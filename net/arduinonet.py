""" ArduinoNet is an asynchronous serial connection wrapper intended for
	communication with Arduino micro controllers over USB. It is important to note
	that due to the nature of Arduino processors, they are unable to communicate
	with external devices over USB without blocking program execution. For this
	reason, it is strongly recommended that any program making use of this class
	operates at the mercy of the Arduino, rather than the letting the Arduino lock
	up pending a transmission.
